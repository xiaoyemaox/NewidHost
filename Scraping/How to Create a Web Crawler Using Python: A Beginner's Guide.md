# How to Create a Web Crawler Using Python: A Beginner's Guide

Web crawling is the process of automatically visiting web pages to extract useful information. A web crawler, also known as a spider or bot, is a program designed to perform this task. In this guide, weâ€™ll walk through how to create two types of web crawlers in Python: one built from scratch using `Requests` and `BeautifulSoup`, and another using the Scrapy framework for more advanced use cases.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

1. **Basic Python knowledge** and Python installed on your machine.
2. The following libraries installed:
   - `Requests` and `BeautifulSoup`:
     ```bash
     pip install requests bs4
     ```
   - `Scrapy` (for advanced crawling):
     ```bash
     pip install scrapy
     ```
3. A virtual Python environment. Use tools like [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html) to avoid dependency conflicts:
   ```bash
   python -m pip install --user pipx
   python -m pipx ensurepath
   ```

## What is a Web Crawler?

A **web crawler** navigates through web pages, starting from a list of URLs (seeds), extracting information like links or data, and adding new links to a queue for further processing. Crawlers can also use metadata files like `robots.txt` or `sitemap.xml` to determine which pages to visit and which to avoid.

### Common Use Cases for Web Crawlers:

1. **SEO Analytics**: Analyze site metadata, backlinks, and broken links.
2. **Price Monitoring**: Track product prices on e-commerce sites.
3. **Search Engines**: Collect and index data for searchability (e.g., Googlebot).
4. **Market Research**: Gather data for trend analysis and customer insights.

## Building a Web Crawler from Scratch

### Using Requests and BeautifulSoup

The `Requests` library allows HTTP requests to be made, while `BeautifulSoup` parses HTML content. Letâ€™s build a basic crawler to extract links from a webpage.

1. **Make an HTTP Request**:
   ```python
   import requests
   from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

   url = 'https://amazon.com/s?k=baby+products'
   response = requests.get(url)
   html = response.text
   soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')
   ```

2. **Extract Links**:
   ```python
   from urllib.parse import urljoin

   links = []
   for link in soup.find_all('a'):
       path = link.get('href')
       if path and path.startswith('/'):
           links.append(urljoin(url, path))

   print(links)
   ```

3. **Recursive Crawling**:
   ```python
   visited = []

   def crawl(url):
       if url in visited:
           return
       visited.append(url)
       print(f'Crawling: {url}')
       try:
           html = requests.get(url).text
           soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')
           for link in soup.find_all('a'):
               path = link.get('href')
               if path and path.startswith('/'):
                   crawl(urljoin(url, path))
       except Exception as e:
           print(f"Failed to crawl: {url}. Error: {e}")

   crawl('https://amazon.com/s?k=baby+products')
   ```

### Limitations of Basic Crawlers:

- **Speed**: Crawlers are slow and lack parallelism.
- **URL Handling**: Relative URLs and static files are not handled efficiently.
- **Compliance**: Crawlers do not obey `robots.txt` by default.
- **Scalability**: Managing large-scale crawls becomes complex.

## Advanced Crawling with Scrapy

Scrapy is a Python framework designed for building fast and efficient web crawlers. It handles many challenges of web crawling, such as parallelism, retry mechanisms, and URL filtering.

### Setting Up Scrapy

1. **Create a New Project**:
   ```bash
   scrapy startproject amazon_crawler
   ```

2. **Generate a Spider**:
   ```bash
   scrapy genspider baby_products amazon.com
   ```
   This creates a file (`baby_products.py`) with a basic spider template.

3. **Define Crawl Rules**:
   ```python
   from scrapy.spiders import CrawlSpider, Rule
   from scrapy.linkextractors import LinkExtractor

   class BabyProductsSpider(CrawlSpider):
       name = 'baby_products'
       allowed_domains = ['amazon.com']
       start_urls = ['https://amazon.com/s?k=baby+products']

       rules = (
           Rule(
               LinkExtractor(restrict_css='.s-pagination-strip'),
               callback='parse_item',
               follow=True
           ),
       )

       def parse_item(self, response):
           products = response.css('div[data-component-type="s-search-result"]')
           for product in products:
               yield {
                   'name': product.css('a.a-text-normal::text').get(),
                   'price': product.css('span.a-price > span.a-offscreen::text').get(),
                   'url': product.css('a.a-text-normal::attr(href)').get(),
               }
   ```

4. **Run the Spider**:
   ```bash
   scrapy crawl baby_products
   ```
