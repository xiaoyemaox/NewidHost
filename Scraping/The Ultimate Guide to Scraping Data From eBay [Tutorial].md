### Step 2: Create & Configure the Scraper

#### (2.1) Enter the eBay Product URL

1. Copy the URL of the eBay product page you want to scrape, such as:
   `https://www.ebay.com/itm/New-Yeezy-Boost-350-Citrin-NRF-FW3042-100-Authentic-and-New-Mens-Multisize/223989490323`
2. Paste the URL into the input field on ProWebScraper and click **Go** to load the page.
