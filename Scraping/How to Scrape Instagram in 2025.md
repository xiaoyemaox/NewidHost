## Why Scrape Instagram?

Instagram is a goldmine of public data, which can be used for:

- **Lead Generation**: Identifying influencers or profiles with similar audiences to expand your business reach.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzing public posts and comments for trends, opinions, and reactions to current events.

## Setting Up Your Instagram Scraper

To create an Instagram scraper, youâ€™ll need Python and the following libraries:

- [`httpx`](https://pypi.org/project/httpx/): To send HTTP requests and retrieve data.
- [`JMESPath`](https://pypi.org/project/jmespath/): To parse and clean JSON data.

For advanced scraping at scale, weâ€™ll also demonstrate how to integrate the [ScraperAPI Python SDK](https://bit.ly/Scraperapi).

## Scraping Instagram Profile Pages

### Step 1: Extracting Profile Data
When visiting a profile page, Instagram triggers a backend API call to retrieve the profileâ€™s JSON data. We can use this API to scrape publicly accessible profile information without logging in.

Hereâ€™s how to set up a scraper for Instagram profile pages:

```python
import httpx

def scrape_instagram_profile(username):
    url = f"https://www.instagram.com/{username}/?__a=1"
    headers = {"User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0"}
    response = httpx.get(url, headers=headers)
    return response.json()

data = scrape_instagram_profile("google")
print(data)
```

### Example Output
```json
{
  "biography": "Google unfilteredâ€”sometimes with filters.",
  "external_url": "https://linkin.bio/google",
  "edge_followed_by": {"count": 13015078},
  "edge_follow": {"count": 33},
  "is_verified": true,
  "profile_pic_url": "https://example.com/profile_pic.jpg",
  "username": "google",
  "full_name": "Google"
}
```

This script retrieves details like bio, follower count, profile picture URL, and verification status.

## Parsing Instagram Profile Data

To clean up the raw JSON data and extract only the relevant fields, we can use JMESPath:

```python
import jmespath

def parse_profile_data(data):
    return jmespath.search("""
        {
            username: username,
            full_name: full_name,
            bio: biography,
            followers: edge_followed_by.count,
            following: edge_follow.count,
            profile_pic: profile_pic_url,
            is_verified: is_verified
        }
    """, data)

parsed_data = parse_profile_data(data)
print(parsed_data)
```

### Parsed Output
```json
{
  "username": "google",
  "full_name": "Google",
  "bio": "Google unfilteredâ€”sometimes with filters.",
  "followers": 13015078,
  "following": 33,
  "profile_pic": "https://example.com/profile_pic.jpg",
  "is_verified": true
}
```

## Scraping Instagram Posts

### Step 1: Extracting Post Data
Instagram uses GraphQL to load post data dynamically. We can send POST requests to its GraphQL endpoint to retrieve details for each post.

Hereâ€™s an example GraphQL query for post data:

```python
import httpx

def scrape_instagram_post(shortcode):
    url = "https://www.instagram.com/graphql/query/"
    params = {
        "query_hash": "2c5d4d8b70cad329c4a6ebe3abb6eedd",
        "variables": {"shortcode": shortcode}
    }
    headers = {"User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0"}
    response = httpx.get(url, params=params, headers=headers)
    return response.json()

post_data = scrape_instagram_post("CJ9KxZ2l8jT")
print(post_data)
```

### Step 2: Parsing Post Data
To simplify post data, we can parse it with JMESPath:

```python
def parse_post_data(data):
    return jmespath.search("""
        {
            id: id,
            shortcode: shortcode,
            caption: edge_media_to_caption.edges[0].node.text,
            likes: edge_media_preview_like.count,
            comments: edge_media_to_comment.count,
            is_video: is_video,
            video_url: video_url,
            display_url: display_url
        }
    """, data)

parsed_post = parse_post_data(post_data)
print(parsed_post)
```

## Avoiding Instagram Blocking with ScraperAPI

Instagram imposes strict rate limits and blocks scraping attempts that exceed the limit. To bypass these restrictions, we can use [ScraperAPI](https://bit.ly/Scraperapi) to manage proxies and CAPTCHA challenges.

Hereâ€™s how to enhance your scraper with ScraperAPI:

```python
from scrapfly import ScrapflyClient, ScrapeConfig

scrapfly = ScrapflyClient(key="YOUR_API_KEY")

response = scrapfly.scrape(ScrapeConfig(
    url="https://www.instagram.com/google/?__a=1",
    asp=True,  # Anti-scraping protection
    country="US",
    render_js=False  # Disable JS rendering unless needed
))

print(response.scrape_result['content'])
```
